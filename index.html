           Every spring, people across India and around the world celebrate the Hindu festival Holi, throwing colored water and powders on one another in joyous celebration. On this one day—the full-moon day of the Hindu month of Phalguna—societal rankings such as caste, gender, age, and status are eschewed in the spirit of making merry together, and everyone is fair game to be doused with color.
           Holi’s traditions vary throughout the country and have their roots in Indian mythology. In many places the festival is associated with the legend of Hiranyakashipu, a demon king in ancient India. Hiranyakashipu enlisted the help of his sister, Holika, to kill his son, Prahlada, a devoted worshipper of the god Vishnu. In an attempt to burn Prahlada, 
           Holika sat with him on a pyre while wearing a cloak that protected her from the fire. But the cloak protected Prahlada instead, and Holika burned. Later that night Vishnu succeeded in killing Hiranyakashipu, and the episode was heralded as a triumph of good over evil. In many places in India, a large pyre is lit on the night before Holi to celebrate this occasion.

            Halloween is a vibrant celebration observed annually on October 31st. While it's now widely recognized for its playful activities and spooky themes, Halloween has a rich history rooted in both ancient Celtic and Western Christian traditions.
            Halloween's origins trace back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced "sow-in"), celebrated over 2,000 years ago in areas now encompassing Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France. 
            Samhain marked the end of the harvest season and the beginning of winter, a time when the boundary between the living and dead was believed to blur, allowing spirits to roam the earth.
